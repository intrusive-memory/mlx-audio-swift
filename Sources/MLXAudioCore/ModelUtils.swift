// MARK: - Float16 Preference for Apple Silicon

/// Controls dtype preference for model weights on Apple Silicon.
///
/// Apple Silicon's GPU ALUs are optimized for float16 (fp16) operations, making
/// them consistently faster than bfloat16 (bf16) for the same model. Since both
/// types are 16-bit, memory usage is identical — the benefit is purely in compute
/// throughput.
///
/// Reference: Apple's Recurrent Drafter research found that fp16 is consistently
/// faster than bf16 on Apple Silicon hardware (M1 through M4).
///
/// By default, `preferFloat16` is `true` — all bfloat16 weights are converted to
/// float16 at load time. Set to `false` to preserve the original weight dtype.
public enum DTypeConfiguration: Sendable {
    /// When `true`, bfloat16 model weights are converted to float16 at load time.

    ///
    /// This operates on the raw `[String: MLXArray]` dictionary that comes from
    /// loading safetensors files, **before** the weights are loaded into a Module.
    /// Only floating-point parameters with `.bfloat16` dtype are converted;
    /// integer types, quantization scales/biases, and float32 parameters are
    /// left untouched.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - weights: The weight dictionary to convert.
    ///   - force: If `true`, convert regardless of the `preferFloat16` setting.
    ///            Defaults to `false` (respects the global setting).

    ///            or the original dictionary if conversion is not requested.
